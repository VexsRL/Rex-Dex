            <h1>New Species of Mosasaur Identified in Mexico</h1>
            <h4 class="date">Nov 24, 2023 by Enrico de Lazaro</h4>
            <h3 class="text">Paleontologists have identified a new species of plioplatecarpine mosasaur from an almost complete skull found in the Agua Nueva Formation, Mexico.</h3>

            <img src="images/news3.jpg" alt="news image" class="news-image">

            
            <p class="text">The newly-identified mosasaur species lived in what is now Mexico approximately 90 million years ago (Turonian age of the Cretaceous period).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Dubbed Yaguarasaurus regiomontanus, this marine reptile had a long, slender rostrum and jaws with small teeth.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The ancient creature was roughly 5.2 m (17 feet) in length, making it one of the earliest known large mosasaurs.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Yaguarasaurus regiomontanus is a member of Mosasauridae, a group of extinct, large marine reptiles from the Late Cretaceous epoch.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “Mosasaurids were fully aquatic, predominantly marine large predatory squamates that were present worldwide in the oceans in the Late Cretaceous,” said Museo del Desierto paleontologist Hector Rivera-Sylva and his colleagues.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “Over 40 genera are recognized, the largest specimens reaching a length of 12 m (39.3 feet).”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “The phylogenetic relationships within Mosasauridae are still contested,” they noted.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “Mosasauridae comprise at least four subfamilies: Halisaurinae, Mosasaurinae, Tylosaurinae, and Plioplatecarpinae, although the details of mosasaur relationships remain controversial and a topic of ongoing study.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “The new mosasaur specimen is referred to Yaguarasaurus, a genus within Plioplatecarpinae.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                An almost complete and well-preserved skull of Yaguarasaurus regiomontanus was discovered southwest of Vallecillo in the northeastern Mexico state of Nuevo Leon, about 80 km north of Monterrey.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The material was collected from a laminated limestone layer of the upper member of the Agua Nueva Formation.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                This limestone is widely known for its abundance of exquisitely preserved fishes and marine reptiles, and formed in an open shelf environment under anoxic conditions.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Along several other plioplatecarpine species, Yaguarasaurus regiomontanus documents the rapid diversification and expansion of plioplatecarpine mosasaurs in the marine realm in the Turonian age.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “The new species closely resembles Yaguarasaurus columbianus from the Turonian of Columbia but exhibits derived features suggesting it may be more closely related to later plioplatecarpines,” the researchers said.</p>
