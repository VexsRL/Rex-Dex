            <h1>135-Million-Year-Old Footprints Reveal New Dinosaur Species</h1>
            <h4 class="date">Dec 4, 2023 by Enrico de Lazaro</h4>
            <h3 class="text">A previously unknown species of small and rapid carnivorous dinosaur lived among the large and dry sand dunes of the Botucatu paleodesert, a vast desert that covered Brazil around 135 million years ago, according to Federal University of Rio de Janeiro paleontologist Giuseppe Leonardi and his colleagues.</h3>

            <img src="images/news2.jpg" alt="news image" class="news-image">

            
            <p class="text">Dr. Leonardi and co-authors discovered numerous footprints of the new theropod dinosaur in the Botucatu Formation near Sao Paulo, Brazil.

                “The sandstones of the Botucatu Formation originally covered a surface estimated in at least 1.3 million km2, the largest known fossil desert in the Earth's history,” the paleontologists said.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “The distribution area of the Botucatu paleodesert presents one of the world's largest megatracksites.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “The tetrapod ichnofauna from the Botucatu Formation comprises minor bipedal dinosaur tracks (almost all attributable to theropods, with one exception, a doubt ornithopod trackway) along with many thousands of footprints of early mammals, and a single trackway of a lacertiform reptile.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “Among the bipedal dinosaur footprints, the most common and typical are considered theropod tracks, with long strides and high step angle and always with an acuminate termination.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                According to the team, the trackmaker was a speedy and small (around 1.5 m in length) carnivorous dinosaur adapted to the large dry sand dunes of the Botucatu paleodesert.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                These tracks are very different from all the other known theropod tracks and represent a new ichnogenus and ichnospecies, named Farlowichnus rapidus.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The name of Farlowichnus rapidus is dedicated to Professor James Farlow, a remarkable paleontologist and ichnologist at Purdue University.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “It's not unusual to name the fossil after a colleague from around the world they want to recognize, and they chose me,” Professor Farlow said.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “It happens often enough that in the grand scheme of things, it's not outstandingly unusual.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “I thought it would be nice if somebody sometime named something after me, but I can't say I seriously coveted it. It would be very gauche to name something after yourself.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                A paper about the discovery was published in October in the journal Cretaceous Research.</p>
