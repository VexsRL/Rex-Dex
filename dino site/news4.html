            <h1>30-Million-Year-Old Fossils Shed Light on Origin of Echolocation in Whales and Dolphins</h1>
            <h4 class="date">Nov 23, 2023 by News Staff</h4>
            <h3 class="text">In a new paper published this month in the journal Diversity, paleontologists described the fossilized skeletons of the dolphin genus Xenorophus from the Oligocene of South Carolina, the United States.</h3>

            <img src="images/news4.jpg" alt="news image" class="news-image">

            
            <p class="text">Whales and dolphins, which lack external ears, rely on echolocation to navigate and hunt in the dark.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Much like shouting and listening for echoes, these animals emit high-pitched sounds that bounce off objects and reflect back at them, allowing them to map out their surroundings.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Their skulls and soft tissues near and within the blowhole are asymmetrical, meaning that a structure on one side is larger or differently shaped than its counterpart on the other side. This lopsidedness enables the production of sound.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                At the same time, a fat-filled lower jawbone conducts sound waves to the internal ear, allowing the animals to locate where sounds are coming from directional hearing.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Yet, how whales and dolphins evolved this sophisticated ‘built-in sonar’ is not fully understood.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In the new research, New York Institute of Technology’s Professor Jonathan Geisler and Dr. Robert Boessenecker from the University of California Museum of Paleontology analyzed a large collection of fossils that included two ancient species of dolphins within the genus Xenorophus: Xenorophus sloanii and the newly-discovered species Xenorophus simplicidens.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                These species are some of the primitive members of Odontoceti, the suborder of marine mammals that includes all living echolocating whales and dolphins.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Xenorophus dolphins were large creatures approximately 3 m long that swam the waters of Eastern North America 25-30 million years ago and likely fed on fish, sharks, sea turtles, and small marine mammals.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Externally, they resembled modern dolphins but had several interlocking molar-like teeth, much like an ancestral land mammal.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Similar to today’s odontocetes, Xenorophus had asymmetry around the blowhole, though not as pronounced as their living relatives.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Notably, they also had a distinct twisting and shifting of the snout several degrees to the left.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Previous studies in other ancient whales suggest that this "snout bend" may be linked to the asymmetrical placement of fat bodies in the jaw, increasing directional hearing abilities.</p>
