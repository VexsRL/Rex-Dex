            <h1>New Species of Triassic Dinosaur Relative Identified in Brazil</h1>
            <h4 class="date">Nov 20, 2023 by Enrico de Lazaro</h4>
            <h3 class="text">A new genus and species of silesaur being named Amanasaurus nesbitti has been discovered by a duo of paleontologists at the Federal University of Santa Maria.</h3>

            <img src="images/news6.jpg" alt="news image" class="news-image">

            
            <p class="text">Amanasaurus nesbitti lived in what is now Brazil during the Carnian age of the Late Triassic epoch, some 233 million years ago.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The ancient creature was a member of Silesauridae, an extinct family of Triassic dinosauriform reptiles.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Silesaurids had a fairly long neck and legs, and possibly quadrupedal habits.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                They are most commonly considered to be a group of non-dinosaur dinosauriforms, and the sister group of dinosaurs.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                They occupied a variety of ecological niches, with early silesaurids being meat-eating and later species having adaptations for specialized herbivory.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “Silesaurs are part of the wide Triassic radiation of archosaurs,” said Federal University of Santa Maria paleontologists Rodrigo Müller and Maurício Garcia.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “Most silesaurs are characterized by slender limbs and a beak-like projection from the anterior tip of the lower jaw.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “Whereas these reptiles are present in the fossil record of Middle to Upper Triassic, no records have been reported from Jurassic or younger layers.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “Silesaurs are particularly interesting because of their close phylogenetic relationships with dinosaurs, with several studies placing silesaurs as the closest evolutionary relatives of dinosaurs.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                In their study, the researchers examined two bone fragments — a portion of a right femur and a portion of a left femur — of Amanasaurus nesbitti.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The fossils were found at the site of Pivetta, between the municipalities of Restinga Sêca and São João do Polêsine, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “It is the first time that silesaurs rivaling in size with early dinosaurs are recovered from the oldest unequivocal dinosaur-bearing beds, challenging the idea that in faunas where silesaurs and unambiguous dinosaurs co-occurred, silesaurs were relatively smaller,” the scientists said.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “This discovery reinforces the complex scenario regarding the radiation of Pan-Aves during the Triassic.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “Surely, the body plan of early diverging forms being surpassed by late diverging dinosaurs does not fit within the current models anymore.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                “Actually, silesaurs — independent of their phylogenetic position — persisted during most of the Triassic period, with its plesiomorphic body size advancing through the dawn of dinosaurs, instead of silesaur lineages decrease in body size through time.”
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The team's results were published in the journal Scientific Reports.</p>
