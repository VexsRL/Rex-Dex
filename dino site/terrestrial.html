The species Tyrannosaurus rex (rex meaning "king" in Latin), often called T. rex or colloquially T-Rex, is one of the best represented theropods. It lived throughout what is now western North America, on what was then an island continent known as Laramidia. <br/>
                        Tyrannosaurus had a much wider range than other tyrannosaurids. Fossils are found in a variety of rock formations dating to the Maastrichtian age of the Upper Cretaceous period, 68 to 66 million years ago. It was the last known member of the tyrannosaurids and among the last non-avian dinosaurs to exist before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event.</p>

                        <p class="description">Spinosaurus (/ˌspaɪnə'sɔ:rəs/; lit. 'spine lizard') is a genus of spinosaurid dinosaur that lived in what now is North Africa during the Cenomanian to upper Turonian stages of the Late Cretaceous period, about 99 to 93.5 million years ago. The genus was known first from Egyptian remains discovered in 1912 and described by German palaeontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915. 
                        The original remains were destroyed in World War II, but additional material came to light in the early 21st century. It is unclear whether one or two species are represented in the fossils reported in the scientific literature. The best known species is S. aegyptiacus from Egypt, although a potential second species, S. maroccanus, has been recovered from Morocco. Spinosaurus is the longest known terrestrial carnivore; other large carnivores comparable to Spinosaurus include theropods such as Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus.</p>

                        <p class="description">Scolosaurus is an extinct genus of ankylosaurid dinosaurs within the subfamily Ankylosaurinae. It contains two species, S. cutleri and S. thronus. The type species, S. cutleri, measured up to 5.6 metres (18 ft) in length and 2.2 metric tons (2.4 short tons) in body mass.
                        <br/>
                        Scolosaurus was named by Franz Nopcsa von Felső-Szilvás in 1928, based on holotype NHMUK R.5161, a nearly complete specimen that preserves the entire skeleton except for the distal end of the tail, the right forelimb, the right hindlimb, and the skull. 
                        The skeleton revealed many anatomical details of the previously unknown Ankylosaurus' armor. The Scolosaurus' armor consisted of numerous osteoderms placed next to each other, arranged in rows along the back and of varying shape and size. Along the midline of the back, the osteoderms were higher, at shoulder height. They took the form of two large spikes.

                        <p class="description">Diplodocus was a genus of diplodocid sauropod dinosaurs, whose fossils were first discovered in 1877 by S. W. Williston. The generic name, is a Neo-Latin term derived from Greek 'diplos' "double" and 'dokos' "beam", in reference to the double-beamed chevron bones located in the underside of the tail, which were then considered unique.
                        The genus of dinosaurs lived in what is now mid-western North America, at the end of the Jurassic period.
                        The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus, Barosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Brontosaurus, and Camarasaurus. Its great size may have been a deterrent to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which suggests that they coexisted with Diplodocus.
                        <br/>
                        Diplodocus is among the most easily identifiable dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known.

                        <p class="description">Dimetrodon is a genus of non-mammalian synapsid that lived during the Cisuralian age of the Early Permian period, around 295-272 million years ago. It is a member of the family Sphenacodontidae. With most species measuring 1.7-4.6 m (5.6-15.1 ft) long and weighing 28-250 kg (62-551 lb), the most prominent feature of Dimetrodon is the large neural spine sail on its back formed by elongated spines extending from the vertebrae. It was an obligate quadruped (it could only walk on four legs) and had a tall, curved skull with large teeth of different sizes set along the jaws. Most fossils have been found in the Southwestern United States, the majority of these coming from a geological deposit called the Red Beds of Texas and Oklahoma. More recently, its fossils have also been found in Germany and over a dozen species have been named since the genus was first erected in 1878.
                        Dimetrodon is often mistaken for a dinosaur but it became extinct some 40 million years before the advent of dinosaurs.

The type species and only species, Anzu wyliei is known from numerous skeletons that preserve cranial and postcranial elements. It was named in 2014 by Matthew C. Lamanna, Hans-Dieter Sues, Emma R. Schachner, and Tyler R. Lyson.

                        Anzu was listed as one of 2014's "Top 10 New Species" discovered, with the findings being of significant scientific value. It was acknowledged again, in 2015, as an unprecedented discovery of scientific worth by the International Institute for Species Exploration.
                        Anzu was probably an omnivore or herbivore, although the beak is not as heavily constructed as in the Asian Oviraptoridae.
